<h1>Matt Viana</h1>

<p>Hello,

I'm Matt Viana, a Data Science graduate with a minor in Computer Science from Pennsylvania State University. My focus is on machine learning, and my future research interests lie in the intersection of machine learning applications in urban mobility and data science, multimodal fine-grained emotional intelligence in large language models (MM-LLMs), and machine learning in financial systems.
