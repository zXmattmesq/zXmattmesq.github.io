<p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">Hello,</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">I'm Matt Viana, a Data Science senior student minoring in Computer Science at <a href="https://ist.psu.edu/">The Pennsylvania State University</a>. I'm an international student from Brazil, and I work as a research assistant for the AI Emotional Intelligence project.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">My focus is on machine learning, and my future research interests as a PhD prospect lie in the intersection of machine learning applications in urban mobility and data science, multimodal fine-grained emotional intelligence in large language models (MM-LLMs), and machine learning in financial systems.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">This website serves as a portfolio and capsule for my work experience and personal projects.</p>
