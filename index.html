<p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">Hello,</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">I'm Matt Viana, a Data Science senior student minoring in Computer Science at <a href="https://ist.psu.edu/">The Pennsylvania State University</a>. I'm an international student from Brazil, and I work as a research assistant for the AI Emotional Intelligence project.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">My focus is on machine learning, and my future research interests as a PhD prospect lie in the intersection of machine learning applications in urban mobility and data science, multimodal fine-grained emotional intelligence in large language models (MM-LLMs), and machine learning in financial systems.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">I am a dedicated research assistant currently working on projects that explore the intersection of technology and human interaction. My work focuses primarily on large language models (LLMs), emotional intelligence in AI, and social bias analysis. I am passionate about developing equitable AI systems that are fair and transparent. My experience spans implementing advanced NLP and computer vision techniques, designing surveys, and conducting literature reviews. I thrive in environments where I can contribute to meaningful advancements in AI while ensuring ethical practices and inclusivity in technology development.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">This website serves as a portfolio and capsule for my work experience and personal projects.</p>
