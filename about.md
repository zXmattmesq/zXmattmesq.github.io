# About Me
<br><br>
I'm **Matheus Mesquita Viana**, a Senior Data Science major with a minor in Computer Science at [The Pennsylvania State University](https://ist.psu.edu/). I have a passion for machine learning, and my goal is to focus on its applications.
<br><br>
I am a dedicated research assistant currently working on projects that explore the intersection of technology and human interaction. My work focuses primarily on large language models (LLMs), emotional intelligence in AI, and social bias analysis. I am passionate about developing equitable AI systems that are fair and transparent. My experience spans implementing advanced NLP and computer vision techniques, designing surveys, and conducting literature reviews. I thrive in environments where I can contribute to meaningful advancements in AI while ensuring ethical practices and inclusivity in technology development.
<br><br>
I chose data science because I wanted to work with machine learning systems to improve public transit. As a 22-year-old who, very recently, had no experience driving, the challenges of public transit and urban mobility are very personal to me.
<br><br>
For me, data science is a tool to map and improve the real world. My passion lies in making a tangible impact on people’s lives. Any algorithmic optimizations or contributions I make in my career should be in service of improving real-world outcomes, rather than data science for its own sake.

## Relevant Work Experience

- **Research Assistant - Working Futures Network, Dana Calacci (Oct 2024 – Current)** 
  Co-authored and secured funding approval for a proposal titled "Mapping Language Model Failures through Community Experience: A Study of Multilingual Researchers," aimed at addressing challenges faced by English as Foreign Language Researchers (EFLRs) in interacting with LLMs. Collaborated on survey design, interview protocols, and methodological frameworks to support equitable AI development. Investigated user interaction with social biases in large language models (LLMs) by analyzing and reviewing current literature. Conducted surveys to study user behavior and perceptions around bias in LLMs. Planned strategies for promoting user-based feedback mechanisms aimed at fostering more inclusive model behavior.

- **AI Research Assistant – AI Emotional Intelligence, College of IST (Feb 2024 – Current)**
  Conducted a literature review on multimodal emotional classification and interaction in large language models (LLMs). Researched NLP and Computer Vision techniques, focusing on the development of models to analyze a wide emotional spectrum. Fine-tuned large language models (LLMs) using TensorFlow and PyCharm, incorporating an improved dataset and model published on Hugging Face. Ran experiments integrating audio, visual, and textual inputs into language models, utilizing clustering techniques and data augmentation.

- **Research Assistant – LGBTQ+ Diversity, Department of Statistics (Jan 2024 – May 2024)**
  Conducted a literature review on surveying techniques for LGBTQ+ populations in higher education and statistical methods for improving response rates and data representation. Managed sensitive data, ensuring ethical management practices and compliance with institutional guidelines. Contributed to discussions on survey deployment and ethical strategies.
