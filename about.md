# About Me
<br><br><br><br>
I'm **Matheus Mesquita Viana**, a Senior Data Science major with a minor in Computer Science at [The Pennsylvania State University](https://ist.psu.edu/). I have a passion for machine learning, and my goal is to focus on its applications.
<br><br><br><br>
I chose a data science because I wanted to work with machine learning systems to improve public transit. As a 22-year-old who, very recently, had no experience driving, the challenges of public transit and urban mobility are very personal to me.
<br><br><br><br>
For me, data science is a tool to map and improve the real world. My passion lies in making a tangible impact on people’s lives. Any algorithmic optimizations or contributions I make in my career should be in service of improving real-world outcomes, rather than data science for its own sake.
