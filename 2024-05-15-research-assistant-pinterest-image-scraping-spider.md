# Research Assistant: Pinterest Image Scraping Spider

**May 2024**

- Built a Pinterest spider using notable tools like Scrapy, BeautifulSoup, and ThreadPoolExecutor to efficiently scrape images and comments based on search terms.
- Improved upon existing tools by creating the `PinterestSpider` class, enabling mass image downloads from Pinterest while leveraging proxy rotation and other security measures.
- Integrated a system to validate and test a list of proxies, saving only the formatted working ones for consistent scraping.
- Automated the process by reading search terms from a text file and iterating through them to download images and comments.
